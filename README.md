# PyTorch-Practice

I've currently got minimal experience with PyTorch however given it's wide applications, I wanted to become familiar with implementations and thought I'd document my journey. 

### PyTorch Notes - Markdown:

- Comments on key parts of PyTorch including: Dynamic computation graphs, Optimising, Datasets, Dataloaders, Softmax & CrossEntropy, Transforms, Activation Functions. 

### PyTorch-Basics - Notebook:

- Convers creating tensors and basic operations. 
- Implements basic Linear Regression Model on the California Housing Project. 
- Explains what a DCG is and how backpropogation works. 

### Logistic Regression - Notebook: 

- Fits a Logisitc regression model on the Breast Cancer Dataset.
- Demonstrates the basics of inheritance from nn.Module. 

### Feed_Forward.ipynb

- Fits a Neural Network on the MNIST Dataset. 
- Shows training data in Batches using Dataloaders, Cross Entropy Loss, Adam optimiser. 
- How to visualise tensors using Matplotlib.
